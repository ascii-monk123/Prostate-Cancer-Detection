# Prostate-Cancer-Detection
Prostate cancer detection using machine learning and feature engineering

## Pipeline
<ul>
<li>Data pre-processubg involved merging the gene sequence and the patient record dataset.</li>
<li>Feature engineering was employed to filter relevant genes from the gene pool.</li>
<li>SVM was used for classification.</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

<ul>

<li>
  Please put the 2 datasets in the same directory as the notebooks.
</li>

<li>
  Please run all the cells of the 'Data_Preprocessing' notebook to generate the dataset ready for processing.
</li>

<li>
  Please run all the cells of the 'Classification_Running' notebook to get the final results in the last 3 cells.
</li>
</ul>
